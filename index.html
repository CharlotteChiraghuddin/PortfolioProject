                    <p class = "mixed-messages active-description">The objective of this project was to build a message generator. Everytime the user runs a program, they should get a new randomized output. The requirements were that we use git version control and the command line, and to develop the project locally. I built this project on Visual Studio Code using html, css, javaScript, node.js and git bash. I chose to have a quote, inspirational quote and a fun fact. Everytime you run the program, it will give you three new random outputs. The output will not be repeated until the program has cycled through all available elements in the array. Below the three boxes are history trackers, which will save all previous outcomes of the randomizer. </p>
                    <p class = "teacozy">For this project, I was provided with a design spec and images. With this, I was asked to replicate the website using my knowledge of html and css. </p>
                    <p class = "naturetrail"> The prompt for this project was to build your own club page that would dynamically respond to screen adjustments. I decided to build my project for a hiking group called Nature Trail Hikes. The website features an about us section intorducing you to the team and also giving a brief summary of the groups purpose, an Upcoming Events section showing destinations the group are planning to hike to, and finally a join now button. I built the website of Visual Studio Code using html and css.</p>
